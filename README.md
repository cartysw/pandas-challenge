# pandas-challenge

Hello!

This is a repo for the Module 4 Pandas Challenge for the UofM Data Analytics Bootcamp. You'll find the jupyter notebook file and the resource files in their respective folders for review.

All credits for inital file formatting and initial sample code included in the file for use in the challenge go to whoever created the starter file/code through the bootcamp course.

Some references were used to aid the creation of this script, which I've included below:

Referenced the pandas documentation for info/syntax on various functions, including: mean(), reset_index(), value_counts(), agg(), and cut(). Links are listed respectively to the functions mentioned:
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.mean.html#pandas.DataFrame.mean

https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.reset_index.html#pandas.DataFrame.reset_index

https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.value_counts.html#pandas.DataFrame.value_counts

https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.agg.html#pandas.DataFrame.agg

https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.cut.html

Referenced this page to find the formula for calculating the per capita spending of the schools:

The Xpert AI Learning Assisstant through the bootcamp course resources was used to help with debugging some parts of the script. Namely the per school capita calculations, the code to reset dataframe indexes, and ironing out syntax for passing percentage calculations.
Credits to the programmer of the AI for assistance with those aspects.

I hope the analysis provided within proves to be insightful and helpful!
